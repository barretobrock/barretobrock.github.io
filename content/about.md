I've always been curious to know more about the things around me. Where to begin?

I'm a software engineer, though over the years, my job titles have carried many different names. I tinker mainly in low-voltage (DC) circuits, primarily for home-automation purposes. I overengineer a lot of my life, maybe in part because I've enjoyed the challenge, but also because some types of repetition annoy while other types enthrall me. 

I'm a wannabe polyglot. I'm familiar with many languages - primarily European ones - and I can speak some of them really well on good days and barely passing on bad ones. I'm an armchair linguist who loves chasing down false friends, homophones and just word origins in general, in part just to better remember the those beautiful, complicated English words that precisely describe what you mean and yet are so difficult to spell unless you somehow remember the root from which they were derived. :) 

I'm all of these things, bundled up into an occasionally funny, human-shaped ball of anxiety. 

Welcome to my site, mind your step & watch out for the bots!

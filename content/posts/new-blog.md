I'm taking some time off of work to focus on some passions of mine. One of them is disseminating information to others eager to learn. While I fully understand that nowadays a personal blog in a custom domain is essentially the backwaters of the SEO-driven internet these days, but my reasoning is less that someone may find this and more that I may be able to more readily link to things I've done in the past to share to Internet People^TM^.

So, over the next few days and weeks, I'll try to dig up older articles from past blog instances and try to give this site some life.

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This post is a recollection of a project that took place about 13 years ago, so details might be hazy and the actual implementation might be either easier or more involved, depending on the tech used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;preamble&#34;&gt;Preamble&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Back in the day, my apartment had hot &amp;amp; cold water meters mounted above the ceiling of my bathroom that served as the water meters for the whole place. The ceiling had these tiles you&amp;rsquo;d remove&lt;sup id=&#34;fnref:1&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;#fn:1&#34; class=&#34;footnote-ref&#34; role=&#34;doc-noteref&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; in order to access the area where the meters were stored, so it wasn&amp;rsquo;t like the meters were immediately visible when you step into the bathroom. It was my task, at the beginning of every month, to grab a chair, lift up one of the ceiling tiles, and record the numbers on the water meters to then send it to the building&amp;rsquo;s maintenance team who also handled billing for utilities. This was a few years before the maintenance team swapped out these manual meters for the more convenient ones that transmitted their data wirelessly to a nearby device, so there was no going around the manual inspection of the gauges.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

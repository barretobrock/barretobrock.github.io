      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;images/circuit-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;Circuit&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-for-this-project&#34;&gt;Motivation for this project&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Shortly after moving in to my current place, I reasoned that I needed an irrigation system to coordinate the occasional drip irrigation to my (mostly native) plants. In this part of Texas, droughts aren&amp;rsquo;t really uncommon, unfortunately, so having this system set up would help provide some stability to the plants while not being much of a strain on my personal bandwidth to water the lawn, as well as the local water district&amp;rsquo;s. Perhaps it goes without saying, but precisely applying water to plants where &amp;amp; when they need it instead of just spraying in their general direction goes a long way towards helping to conserve water while also keeping plants happy.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
